  - Positive motivation
> Our group intends on creating an app that helps students maintain a healthy lifestyle  through making them much more self aware aware of their body mass index. The BMI (Body Mass Index) is a variable calculated with the use of two sub variables being it a person's height as well as their weight. We will be measuring individuals height in centimetres and their weight in kilograms as this is a renowned unit of measure. Upon receiving their results the user will receive a message which would either state that they are healthy or unhealthy or even variating  from specifying that an individual is 'healthy', 'obese', 'annorexic' if means be, although this idea will be further analysed as we intend on composing a questionaire asking several students whether they prefer being told their overweight using the terms 'obese', 'unhealthy' or any other preferable terms in order to lighten the appeal. Whilst an individual is found to be unhealthy, a pop up or message redirecting them to health forum websites will be offered.
> Our program does not aim to make users feel insecure about their BMI thus in every result a positive motivational BLESSING will appear, offering the user a sense of enlightenment. Confucious type quotes are those that we will be imposing on our app.
